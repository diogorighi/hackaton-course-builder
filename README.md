#VanHackaton Challenge: Thinkific Course Builder 

The course builder app should allow users to easily create a course with all different media contents.
We aimed to build a project following best practices, coding in a modular and concise way for better code maintainability but not forgetting about UX.

Technologies used on this challenge:

**Front-end:** Bootstrap dashboard template and jQuery 

**Back-end:** Node.js and MongoDB

During the challenge our team could work in a very good flow using Git, good and clear communication was essential skill to this project.
At first we had some difficult because of our database model and needed to update it in order to achieve best result.

To install, just clone the project, `npm install` and run `node bin/www`.
